tidymrp makes it easy to run multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) analyses in R. It fits neatly into the tidyverse and can be used with a range of modelling packages from frequentist to Bayesian.

The focus of the package is on providing functions useful for MRP workflows including creating poststratification frames, poststratifying and visualising MRP results.
