<!-- ```{r setup} -->
<!-- library(tidyverse) -->
<!-- library(tidymrp) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- MRP needs two datasets: -->
<!-- 1. A survey -->
<!-- 1. A poststratification frame -->

<!-- ## Poststratification Frame -->

<!-- A poststratification frame splits the population we are interested in into discrete groups. Formally this is called a _partition_: each person in the population belongs to exactly one group. These groups are called _stratas_. Hence _poststratification_: a splitting of the population into _stratas_ and _post_ because it is done after the sample is collected. (This is opposed to stratified sampling, a type of probabilistic sampling.) -->

<!-- There are a few ways to get a poststratification frame. We can either get a pre-prepared one or make one. To make one we need a census. (For more details, see the vignette [creating a poststratification frame](creating_a_poststratification_frame)). -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- poststratification_frame <- example_census %>% -->
<!--   create_poststratification_frame(strata_variables = c(region, age_group), -->
<!--                                   weight_column = population_total) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- So now we know how many people are in each strata. But what do those people do? -->

<!-- ## Creating a model of responses -->

<!-- We want to build a model that can predict the response of any person. This is where the survey comes in useful. We can create a model to predict their response based on the socio-demographic information included in the poststratification frame. (This is often a limiting factor, though there are ways around it. To explore alternatives, look at the vignette on [advanced poststratification](advanced_poststratification).) We chose a poststratification frame that includes region and age, so our model should be based on that. -->

<!-- Model fitting is not a copy and paste job. For an overview, see [multilevel_regression_guide] and for a more in-depth discussion, read [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) or [Bayesian Data Analysis](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/). -->

<!-- Let's look at our survey. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- example_survey -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note first that the survey and poststratification classifications do not neatly overlap. In the census, we have 'age_group' and in the survey we have a finer variable of 'age'. We need to make the survey look like the census. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- example_survey <- example_survey %>% -->
<!--   mutate(age_group = case_when( -->
<!--     age %in% 16:24 ~ "16_to_24", -->
<!--     age %in% 25:34 ~ "25_to_34", -->
<!--     age %in% 35:44 ~ "35_to_44", -->
<!--     age %in% 45:54 ~ "45_to_54", -->
<!--     age %in% 55:64 ~ "55_to_64", -->
<!--     age >= 65 ~ "65_plus") -->
<!--   ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- There are two responses we can model. We will model the binary response because it is simpler. The binary response is either 0 or 1. If we assume that each strata has a probability of answering 0 or 1, the best likelihood we can use is a binomial distribution. (Technically, it is the maximum entropy distribution i.e. it doesn't claim to know any more than we do.) -->

<!-- tidymrp can be used with various model packages. Let's use [brms](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/). -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- library(brms) -->
<!-- options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()) -->
<!-- binary_model_1 <- brms::brm(binary_response ~ 1 + (1 | region) + (1 | age_group), -->
<!--                             family = bernoulli(), -->
<!--                             data = example_survey, -->
<!--                             chains = parallel::detectCores(), -->
<!--                             iter = 200, # 200 is normally enough to get the idea -->
<!--                             file = "models/binary_model_1" -->
<!--                             ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Combining the model and poststratification -->

<!-- Now we have a model that predicts the response based on age and region. We also have a poststratification frame that tells us how many people are in each age and region strata. We can get the estimates for each section we are interested in now. -->


<!-- <!-- ```{r} --> -->
<!-- <!-- strata_estimates <- get_strata_estimates(model = binary_model_1, --> -->
<!-- <!--                                          new_data = poststratification_frame, --> -->
<!-- <!--                                          group_variables = c(age_group, region), lower_confidence = 0.2) --> -->
<!-- <!-- ``` --> -->

<!-- <!-- Often we are less interested in the results by strata, as we are in the results by region. --> -->

<!-- <!-- ```{r} --> -->
<!-- <!-- strata_estimates %>% --> -->
<!-- <!--   left_join(poststratification_frame, by = c("age_group", "region")) --> -->
<!-- <!-- ``` --> -->


<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- add_proportion(poststratification_frame, -->
<!--                model_variables = c(age_group, region), -->
<!--                estimates_by = region, -->
<!--                weight_column = population_total) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- poststratified_estimates <- get_poststratified_estimates(model = binary_model_1, -->
<!--                              new_data = poststratification_frame, -->
<!--                              model_variables = c(age_group, region), -->
<!--                              estimates_by = region) -->

<!-- poststratified_estimates -->
<!-- ``` -->
